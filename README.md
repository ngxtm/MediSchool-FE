## Development & Testing Tools

### TestResetPassword Component

The `TestResetPassword` component (`src/components/TestResetPassword.jsx`) is a development utility for testing the password recovery workflow:

**Features:**

- **Email Testing Interface**: Simple form to trigger password reset emails for any email address
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages with clear visual indicators (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- **Step-by-step Guide**: Built-in instructions for testing the complete password recovery flow
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Development Logging**: Integration with browser console for debugging

**Usage:**

```jsx
import TestResetPassword from '@/components/TestResetPassword'

// Use in development pages or admin panels
;<TestResetPassword />
```

**Testing Workflow:**

1. Enter test email address
2. Click "G·ª≠i Email Reset Password"
3. Check email inbox (including spam folder)
4. Click the "üîí ƒê·∫∑t l·∫°i m·∫≠t kh·∫©u" link in email
5. Verify redirect to `/update-password` page
6. Monitor browser console for debug logs

> **Note**: This component is intended for development and testing purposes only. It should not be included in production builds.

## Authentication Flow

The application implements a sophisticated authentication system with automatic routing:

### AuthRedirect Component

The `AuthRedirect` component handles intelligent routing based on authentication state:

1. **Password Recovery Detection**: Automatically detects recovery sessions from email reset links (`type=recovery` in URL hash)
2. **Session Validation**: Checks both localStorage and sessionStorage for valid sessions
3. **Role-based Routing**: Redirects users to appropriate dashboards based on their role (ADMIN, MANAGER, NURSE, PARENT)
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles expired sessions and authentication errors with automatic cleanup

### UpdatePassword Component

The `UpdatePassword` component (`src/pages/UpdatePassword.jsx`) handles secure password updates with enhanced user experience:

**Key Features:**

- **Dual Loading States**: Separate `initialLoading` and `loading` states for better UX during session validation and password updates
- **Recovery Session Detection**: Automatic detection and handling of password recovery sessions from email links
- **Enhanced Token Validation**: Secure token validation using direct API calls without immediately setting sessions, improving security by validating tokens before use
- **Session Management**: Handles both recovery sessions and regular authenticated sessions with improved token storage
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Type-safe error handling with proper string validation to prevent runtime errors
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with actionable next steps for users
- **Auto-redirect**: Automatic navigation to login page after successful password update

**Loading State Management:**

- `initialLoading`: Controls initial session validation and recovery token processing - shows "ƒêang x√°c th·ª±c..." spinner
- `loading`: Controls form submission and password update operations - shows "ƒêang c·∫≠p nh·∫≠t..." on submit button

This dual loading state approach ensures users see appropriate loading indicators during different phases:

1. **Initial Load**: Spinner with "ƒêang x√°c th·ª±c..." while validating recovery tokens and sessions
2. **Form Submission**: Button state change to "ƒêang c·∫≠p nh·∫≠t..." during password update

**Security Improvements:**

The component now implements enhanced security measures for password recovery:

- **Token Pre-validation**: Recovery tokens are validated via direct API calls before being used to set sessions
- **Secure Token Storage**: Tokens are temporarily stored in sessionStorage and only used when needed for password updates
- **Session Isolation**: Recovery sessions are immediately cleared after successful password updates to prevent token reuse
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better distinction between token validation errors and general authentication errors

**Error Handling Improvements:**

The component now includes robust type-safe error handling that:

- Validates error types before string operations to prevent runtime errors
- Provides fallback error messages for non-string error objects
- Differentiates between token-related errors and general errors for better user guidance
- Ensures consistent error display regardless of error object structure

**Error Handling Improvements:**

The component now includes robust type-safe error handling that:

- Validates error types before string operations to prevent runtime errors
- Provides fallback error messages for non-string error objects
- Differentiates between token-related errors and general errors for better user guidance
- Ensures consistent error display regardless of error object structure

This separation provides clear, contextual feedback about what the system is doing at each stage of the password update process.

### Authentication Utilities

The `src/utils/auth.js` module provides essential authentication functions:

- **`clearExpiredSession()`**: Cleans up all authentication-related storage items including tokens, temporary sessions, and user preferences
- **`hasStoredSession()`**: Checks for existing valid sessions in both localStorage and sessionStorage
- **Session Management**: Handles Supabase project-specific token storage and retrieval

### Supported Routes

- `/login` - Authentication page
- `/update-password` - Password recovery page (auto-detected from email recovery links)
- `/admin` - Administrator dashboard
- `/manager` - Manager dashboard
- `/nurse` - Nurse dashboard
- `/parent` - Parent dashboard
- `/no-role` - Fallback for users without assigned roles

> **Note**: The `/update-password` route is automatically triggered when users access the application through password recovery email links. The system detects the `type=recovery` parameter in the URL hash and redirects accordingly.
